# SmallData

A decentralized asset indexing and search platform built on FlexNet JSX Framework, leveraging blockchain technology to create a secure, distributed catalog of digital assets across multiple cloud providers.

## Overview

SmallData simplifies asset discovery and management by connecting to multiple cloud storage providers, indexing assets using advanced AI models, and storing the index metadata on decentralized networks. This approach enables universal search while maintaining data sovereignty and security.

Built for both enterprise organizations and individuals, SmallData creates a bridge between traditional cloud services and decentralized storage systems.

## Hybrid Architecture Approach

SmallData adopts a hybrid approach across multiple dimensions:

- **Hybrid Data Storage**
  - Integrates with traditional cloud storage (AWS S3, Google Drive, Dropbox)
  - Works with on-premise storage systems
  - Supports personal device storage
  - Connects with emerging decentralized storage protocols (IPFS, Filecoin, Arweave)

- **Hybrid Indexing Models**
  - Text-based indexing for documents and metadata
  - AI vision models for image content recognition
  - Audio fingerprinting for media files
  - Graph-based indexing for relationship mapping
  - Semantic vector embeddings for conceptual search

- **Hybrid Database Technologies**
  - Relational databases for structured metadata
  - Document databases for flexible schema storage
  - Vector databases for similarity and semantic search
  - Graph databases for relationship querying
  - Time-series databases for historical tracking

- **Hybrid Decentralized Networks**
  - Traditional blockchains (Ethereum, Solana)
  - Directed acyclic graph (DAG) networks
  - Proof-of-storage networks
  - Federated consensus mechanisms
  - Custom private consensus networks for enterprise deployments

This hybrid approach enables SmallData to optimize for specific use cases while maintaining flexibility across different storage environments and access patterns.
